Wheelbuilding book for wheel building            <===
What is the best wheel building book, and why?
Thanks for your opinions. I appreciate them.
Wheelbuilding book for wheel building
Buy it online, download it, print it, have it spiral bound at Staples.
All future updates are free.  Try that with any other book.
Roger's working on edition 6 right now.
Worst one IMO - Schraner's. Yep I own that too.
