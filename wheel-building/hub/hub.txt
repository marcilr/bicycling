Spacing
=======
The spacing of a hub is measured from the outside faces of the cone
locknuts, where they come into contact with the frame's forkends.
(Most cartridge-bearing type hubs don't have locknuts, so the spacing
is measured from the equivalent shoulder surface of the axle ends.)
The spacing dimension is commonly referred to as the "O.L.D."
(Over-Lock-nut Distance)
