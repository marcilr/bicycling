Chris King RingDrive Lube


Chris King RingDrive lube is specifically designed to work with
the patented RingDrive engagement system found on all Chris King
hubs.  It is engineered for high performance at all temperatures
and less rolling resistance.

Additional Information:
1.2 fl oz
1.2 oz. will do 12 overhauls

Not recommended for the Chris King R45 hub.  For the R45 we recommend
using a synthetic motor oil such as Mobil 1 5/20.
