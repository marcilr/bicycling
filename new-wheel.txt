Swung by the Trek store on Benson near Amsteram.  Asked for recommendations
for a new set of wheels for winter use.  I advised use of King hubs.

Salemans advised 32 spokes with use of Bontrager rims.


hubs: Chris King ISO
rim:  Recommended Bontrager 19-25 millimeter rim

What is the best wheel building book, and why?
Thanks for your opinions. I appreciate them.
Wheelbuilding book for wheel building
Buy it online, download it, print it, have it spiral bound at Staples.
All future updates are free.  Try that with any other book.
Roger's working on edition 6 right now.
Worst one IMO - Schraner's. Yep I own that too.
