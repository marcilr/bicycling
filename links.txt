The Utility of Clipless Pedals, or, Why I Ditched My Spuds

Wow, “the non-clipless pedals did slightly better” blows me away.
I’ve been commuting 10 to 20 miles everyday in Anchorage, winter
and summer, for 20 odd years.  Completely subscribe to the
“clipless are way more efficient due to the ability to pull up
on the pedal stroke.”  Can’t fathom doing climbs like Glen Alps
(road and/or Powerline), bit of a climb outside town, without
clipless pedals.  That said with SPD cleats, Shimano shoes,
and Crankbrothers eggbeatears the issue I have is warmth.
In single digits or negative temps my feet refuse to stay warm.
In winter use powergrips.com straps over boots.  I need to find
a warm winter boot with cleats.  That said after reading clipless
“SPD-equipped Birkenstock sandals” it gives me incentive to make
a pair of clipless boots. Stomp and go.
