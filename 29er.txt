29er

=============================
Picked up the bike today from The Bicycle shop on Dimond
after work.  Expensive at $296 (Cabela's card).  That said
left brake is fixed.  Think they swapped in a new cassette
or whatever was out in the rear hub.  Makes a nice clicking
noise when free rotating.  Very nice.

FIXME: Add cost breakdown from reciept.

Swapped on the Fast Trak Control (spelling) tires this evening
for the 29 inch Nokian 294 tires.  Looking forward to a fast
ride tomorrow.  Summer has arrived!
