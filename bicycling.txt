Bicycling

=============================
Fast day yet of 34 minites from home to planet fitness at the northway mall
north of GCI's AOC at the old ADN building.  Have been riding Shena's Giant
Trance as I took the Specialized Rockhopping into Paramount last Saterday
and discovered it had a cracked frame behind the bottom bracket on the right.
Left at 6:22AM and had bike locked at 6:56AM. 8 + 26 = 34 minutes

Did not see any civilians on the Cambell Creek trail, Lake Otis, or Chester
Creek trail.  Did see a small dog in the middle of the road on East 47th
after getting off the Cambell Creek trail.  Avoided him and kept on moving.

Yesterday, I did a time of 37 minutes that was the 2nd time I did the previous
fastest time.  Left at 7:01AM and had bike locked at 7:38AM.  Didn't record
the date of the 1st time I did 37 minutes.  That was on the now defunct
Specialized Rockhopper.
