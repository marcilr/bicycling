Beautiful ride today at 48F.  Swapped out the Power Grips pedals out
for the Crankbrothers clipless this morning.  On Saterday I picked up
the Shimano shoes from Boot Country for $90.  I had them in to the shop
to get the heals repaired with fine leather.  They did a great job and
also replaced the velcro on the straps up top.   Fine job.

=============================
Yesterday my left PowerGrips pedal axle sheared off on the
inside edge of the pedal.  Then proceeded to get caught in
the rear spokes.  Went down on my side.  On the sidewalk
in front of Amsterdam on the way to gym and work.

Replaced the pedal with one that had a smaller strap in
the garage.  Remembered the rentention bolts have to
be cut off to remove.

Today road in with new pedal strap on the left.
Very nice.

Road in to work today via Campbell Creek.  The Chester Creek bridge had
been painted yesterday as it was bare on Monday when I went past.
Looks good although the North side is lacking a foot and a half strip
of asphalt about 4 inches deep.  Not quite ridable yet so I pushed the
Rockhopper across.  Very nice.

Fri Apr  1 08:21:31 AKDT 2016
=============================
Fast day yet of 34 minites from home to planet fitness at the northway mall
north of GCI's AOC at the old ADN building.  Have been riding Shena's Giant
Trance as I took the Specialized Rockhopping into Paramount last Saterday
and discovered it had a cracked frame behind the bottom bracket on the right.
Left at 6:22AM and had bike locked at 6:56AM. 8 + 26 = 34 minutes

Did not see any civilians on the Cambell Creek trail, Lake Otis, or Chester
Creek trail.  Did see a small dog in the middle of the road on East 47th
after getting off the Cambell Creek trail.  Avoided him and kept on moving.

Yesterday, I did a time of 37 minutes that was the 2nd time I did the previous
fastest time.  Left at 7:01AM and had bike locked at 7:38AM.  Didn't record
the date of the 1st time I did 37 minutes.  That was on the now defunct
Specialized Rockhopper.
